Tutorial: Fly-by Induced Binary Black Hole Mergers in the Galactic Field
==============================================================================

This script demonstrates the full workflow for simulating Fly-by Induced
Binary Black Hole mergers in the Milky Way Field.

It covers:
1. Initialize/Re-run the simulation with custom galaxy properties.
2. Sample merger eccentricities (e.g., for LIGO rate estimation).
3. Analyze the underlying "Progenitor Population" (the static population of binaries destined to merge).
4. Generate "Snapshots" of the current MW Field fly-by induced high-e BBH population for LISA analysis.
